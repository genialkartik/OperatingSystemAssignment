# OperatingSystemAssignment
It is an Assignment, designated in Operating System.

Problem 1:

Considering 4 processes with the arrival time and the burst time requirement of the processes the scheduler schedules the processes by interrupting the processor after every 3 units of time and does consider the completion of the process in this iteration. The schedulers then checks for the number of processes waiting for the processor and allots the processor to the process but interrupting the processor after every 6 units of time and considers the completion of the process in this iteration. The scheduler after the second iteration checks for the number of processes waiting for the processor and now provides the processor to the process with the least time requirement to go in the terminated state.
Develop a scheduler which submits the processes to the processor in the above defined scenario, and compute the scheduler performance by providing the waiting time for process, turnaround time for process and average waiting time and turnaround time. 



Problem 2:

Given five memory partitions of 100 KB, 500 KB, 200 KB, 300 KB, and 600 KB (in order), how would each of the first-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit algorithms place processes of 212 KB, 417 KB, 112 KB, and 426 KB (in order)? Write a program in C which will print the mapping of processes with memory partitions for both the algorithms.
